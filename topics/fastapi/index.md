**FastAPI** is a high-performance, easy-to-learn, fast-to-code Python 3.7+ framework ready for production. It boasts performance on par with NodeJS and Go, thanks to Starlette and Pydantic. FastAPI is intuitive and standards-based, following API standards like OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.
